# Python logging

Dagster is compatible and configurable with [Python's logging module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html). Configuration options are set in a [`dagster.yaml` file](/deployment/dagster-instance), which will apply the contained settings to any run launched from the instance.

Configuration settings include:

- The Python loggers to capture from
- The log level loggers are set to
- The handlers/formatters used to process log messages produced by runs

## Production environments and event log storage

In a production context, it's recommended that you be selective about which logs are captured. It's possible to overload the event log storage with these events, which may cause some pages in the UI to take a long time to load.

To mitigate this, you can:

- Capture only the most critical logs
- Avoid including debug information if a large amount of run history will be maintained

---

## Capturing Python logs <Experimental />

By default, logs generated using the Python logging module aren't captured into the Dagster ecosystem. This means that they aren't stored in the Dagster event log, will not be associated with any Dagster metadata (such as step key, run ID, etc.), and won't show up in the default view of the [Dagster UI](/concepts/webserver/ui).

For example, imagine you have the following code:

```python file=/concepts/logging/python_logger.py startafter=start_python_logger endbefore=end_python_logger dedent=4
import logging

from dagster import graph, op

@op
def ambitious_op():
    my_logger = logging.getLogger("my_logger")
    try:
        x = 1 / 0
        return x
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        my_logger.error("Couldn't divide by zero!")

    return None
```

Because this code uses a custom Python logger instead of `context.log`, the log statement won't be added as an event to the Dagster event log or show up in the UI.

However, this default behavior can be changed to treat these sort of log statements the same as `context.log` calls. This can be accomplished by setting the `managed_python_loggers` key in `dagster.yaml` file to a list of Python logger names that you would like to capture:

```yaml file=/concepts/logging/python_logging_managed_loggers_config.yaml
python_logs:
  managed_python_loggers:
    - my_logger
    - my_other_logger
```

Once this key is set, Dagster will treat any normal Python log call from one of the listed loggers in the exact same way as a `context.log` call. This means you should be able to see this log statement in the UI:

<Image
alt="log-python-error"
src="/images/concepts/logging/log-python-error.png"
width={1165}
height={250}
/>

**Note**: If `python_log_level` is set, the loggers listed here will be set to the given level before a run is launched. Refer to the [Configuring global log levels](#configuring-global-log-levels) for more info and an example.

---

## Configuring global log levels <Experimental />

To set a global log level in a Dagster instance, set the `python_log_level` parameter in your instance's `dagster.yaml` file.

This setting controls the log level of all loggers managed by Dagster. By default, this will just be the `context.log` logger. If there are custom Python loggers that you want to capture, refer to the [Capturing Python logs section](#capturing-python-logs).

Setting a global log level allows you to filter out logs below a given level. For example, setting a log level of `INFO` will filter out all `DEBUG` level logs:

```yaml file=/concepts/logging/python_logging_python_log_level_config.yaml
python_logs:
  python_log_level: INFO
```

---

## Configuring Python log handlers <Experimental />

In your `dagster.yaml` file, you can configure handlers and formatters that will apply to the Dagster instance. This will apply the same logging configuration to all runs.

For example:

```yaml file=/concepts/logging/python_logging_handler_config.yaml
python_logs:
  dagster_handler_config:
    handlers:
      myHandler:
        class: logging.StreamHandler
        level: INFO
        stream: ext://sys.stdout
        formatter: myFormatter
    formatters:
      myFormatter:
        format: "My formatted message: %(message)s"
```

Handler and formatter configuration follows the [dictionary config schema format](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html#logging-config-dictschema) in the Python logging module. Only the `handlers` and `formatters` dictionary keys will be accepted, as Dagster creates loggers internally.

From there, standard `context.log` calls will output with the configured handlers and formatters. After execution, read the output log file `my_dagster_logs.log`. As expected, the log file contains the formatted log:

/>

## Examples

### Creating a captured Python logger without modifying dagster.yaml

To create a logger that's captured by Dagster without modifying your `dagster.yaml` file, use the <PyObject module="dagster" object="get_dagster_logger"/> utility function. This pattern is useful when logging from inside nested functions, or other cases where it would be inconvenient to thread through the context parameter to enable calls to `context.log`.

For example:

```python file=/concepts/logging/python_logger.py startafter=start_get_logger endbefore=end_get_logger dedent=4
from dagster import get_dagster_logger, graph, op

@op
def ambitious_op():
    my_logger = get_dagster_logger()
    try:
        x = 1 / 0
        return x
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        my_logger.error("Couldn't divide by zero!")

    return None
```

<Note>
  <strong>Heads up!</strong> The logging module retains global state, meaning
  the logger returned by this function will be identical if{" "}
  <PyObject module="dagster" object="get_dagster_logger" /> is called multiple
  times with the same arguments in the same process. This means that there may
  be unpredictable or unituitive results if you set the level of the returned
  Python logger to different values in different parts of your code.
</Note>

### Outputting Dagster logs to a file

If you want to output all Dagster logs to a file, use the Python logging module's built-in [`logging.FileHandler`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.FileHandler) class. This sends log output to a disk file.

To enable this, define a new `myHandler` handler in your `dagster.yaml` file to be a `logging.FileHandler` object:

```yaml file=/concepts/logging/python_logging_file_output_config.yaml
python_logs:
  dagster_handler_config:
    handlers:
      myHandler:
        class: logging.FileHandler
        level: INFO
        filename: "my_dagster_logs.log"
        mode: "a"
        formatter: timeFormatter
    formatters:
      timeFormatter:
        format: "%(asctime)s :: %(message)s"
```

You can also configure a formatter to apply a custom format to the logs. For example, to include a timestamp with the logs, we defined a custom formatter named `timeFormatter` and attached it to `myHandler`.

If we execute the following job:

```python file=/concepts/logging/file_output_pipeline.py startafter=start_custom_file_output_log endbefore=end_custom_file_output_log
@op
def file_log_op(context: OpExecutionContext):
    context.log.info("Hello world!")


@job
def file_log_job():
    file_log_op()
```

And then read the `my_dagster_logs.log` output log file, we'll see the log file contains the formatted log:

<Image
alt="log-file-output"
src="/images/concepts/logging/log-file-output.png"
width={2048}
height={484}
/>
