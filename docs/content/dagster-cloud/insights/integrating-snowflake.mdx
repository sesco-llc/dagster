# Integrating Direct Snowflake Usage with Dagster Cloud Insights (Experimental)

<Note>
  This feature is considered <strong>experimental</strong>.
</Note>

External metrics, such as Snowflake credits, can be integrated into the Dagster Insights UI. The [`dagster-cloud`](https://pypi.org/project/dagster-cloud/) package contains utilities for capturing and submitting external metrics about data operations to Dagster Cloud via an API.

If you use the [Snowflake Resource](/\_apidocs/libraries/dagster-snowflake) to query Snowflake, use this guide to integrate Snowflake metrics into the Insights UI. For instructions on integrating usage of dbt models which run in Snowflake, see [Integrating Snowflake + dbt with Dagster Cloud Insights](/dagster-cloud/insights/integrating-snowflake-and-dbt).

---

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this guide, you'll need:

- A Dagster Cloud account on the Enterprise plan
- Access to the [Dagster Cloud Insights feature](/dagster-cloud/insights)
- Snowflake credentials which have access to the `snowflake.account_usage.query_history` table. For more information on granting access to this table, see the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage#enabling-the-snowflake-database-usage-for-other-roles).
- To install the following libraries:

  ```shell
  pip install dagster dagster-cloud dagster-snowflake
  ```

  **Note**: If you already have `dagster-cloud` installed, **make sure you're using version 1.5.8 or newer**.

## Step 1: Replace your Snowflake resources

The first step is to replace any existing Snowflake resources with <PyObject module="dagster_cloud" object="InsightsSnowflakeResource" />. This resource is a drop-in replacement for the <PyObject module="dagster_snowflake" object="SnowflakeResource" /> resource, but it also emits Snowflake usage metrics to the Dagster Cloud Insights API.

```python
from dagster_cloud.dagster_insights import InsightsSnowflakeResource

defs = Definitions(
  resources={
    "snowflake": InsightsSnowflakeResource(
      account=EnvVar("SNOWFLAKE_PURINA_ACCOUNT"),
      user=EnvVar("SNOWFLAKE_PURINA_USER"),
      password=EnvVar("SNOWFLAKE_PURINA_PASSWORD"),
    ),
 }
)
```

## Step 2: Create a metrics ingestion pipeline in Dagster

The second step is to create a Dagster pipeline that joins asset observation events with the Snowflake query history and calls the Dagster Cloud ingestion API. Snowflake usage information is available at a delay, so this pipeline will run on a schedule to ingest Snowflake usage information from the previous hour.

To do this, you'll need a Snowflake resource (<PyObject module="dagster_snowflake" object="InsightsSnowflakeResource" />) that can query the `snowflake.account_usage.query_history` table. You can set up the ingestion pipeline like the following:

```python
from dagster import Definition, EnvVar

from dagster_cloud.dagster_insights import (
    InsightsSnowflakeResource,
    create_snowflake_insights_asset_and_schedule,
)

snowflake_insights_definitions = create_snowflake_insights_asset_and_schedule(
    start_date="2023-10-5-00:00",
    snowflake_resource_key="snowflake_insights",
)

defs = Definitions(
  assets=[..., *snowflake_insights_definitions.assets],
  schedules=[..., snowflake_insights_definitions.schedule],
  resources={
    ...,
    "snowflake_insights": InsightsSnowflakeResource(
      account=EnvVar("SNOWFLAKE_PURINA_ACCOUNT"),
      user=EnvVar("SNOWFLAKE_PURINA_USER"),
      password=EnvVar("SNOWFLAKE_PURINA_PASSWORD"),
    ),
 }
)
```

In this example, the `snowflake_resource_key` is a <PyObject module="dagster_snowflake" object="SnowflakeResource" /> that has access to the `query_history` table.

Once the pipeline runs, Snowflake credits will be visible in the **Insights** tab in the Dagster UI:
